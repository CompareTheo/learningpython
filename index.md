# Learning Python @ WHHL.
{: .fs-9 }

Over the summer of 2022, we will learn some of the basics of the python programming language with an eye towards its usefulness in the library context.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

## Getting started

### Installing Python

- There are many different options/methods for installing Python. While there are best practices for managing your python development environment, we are not going to stress about these best practices for the purpose of learning the language.
- For the purposes of this tutorial, we are going to install Miniconda which is a very bare bones graphical installer for python that handles all of the system PATH changes. 
- We have chosen Miniconda because it comes packaged with pip3 & bare bones python. This will allow us to learn to manually manage packages and to have the graphical installer deal with the PATH settings necessary for interacting with the Windows shell.
- It should be noted, that unlike other python distributions, Miniconda does not come with additional installs outside of the standard python distribution.

### Quick start: Use as a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` as a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)

```yaml
remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs
```

<small>You must have GitHub Pages enabled on your repo, one or more Markdown files, and a `_config.yml` file. [See an example repository](https://github.com/pmarsceill/jtd-remote)</small>

### Local installation: Use the gem-based theme

1. Install the Ruby Gem
  ```bash
  $ gem install just-the-docs
  ```
  ```yaml
  # .. or add it to your Jekyll site’s Gemfile
  gem "just-the-docs"
  ```

2. Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll site’s `_config.yml`
  ```yaml
  theme: "just-the-docs"
  ```

3. _Optional:_ Initialize search data (creates `search-data.json`)
  ```bash
  $ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init
  ```

3. Run your local Jekyll server
  ```bash
  $ jekyll serve
  ```
  ```bash
  # .. or if you're using a Gemfile (bundler)
  $ bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```


4. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you're hosting your site on GitHub Pages, [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) so that you can more easily work in your development environment.

### Configure Just the Docs
