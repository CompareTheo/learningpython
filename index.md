{: .fs-9 }

Over the summer of 2022, we will learn some of the basics of the python programming language with an eye towards its usefulness in the library context.

## Getting started

### Installing Python

- There are many different options/methods for installing Python. While there are best practices for managing your python development environment, we are not going to stress about these best practices for the purpose of learning the language.
- For the purposes of this tutorial, we are going to install Miniconda which is a very bare bones graphical installer for python that handles all of the system PATH changes. 
- We have chosen Miniconda because it comes packaged with pip3 & bare bones python. This will allow us to learn to manually manage packages and to have the graphical installer deal with the PATH settings necessary for interacting with the Windows shell.
- It should be noted, that unlike other python distributions, Miniconda does not come with additional installs outside of the standard python distribution.

### Special Instructions for Installing Miniconda

- Download (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)[Miniconda]
- Accept the license terms
- Be sure to choose "Current user." This is particularly important given that we are going to want to update system path as a part of this installer.
- Be sure to select "Add Miniconda to the system PATH environment variable.
- When the install is finished, it is not necessary to open the "Anaconda Distribution Tutorial" or the "Getting Started with Anaconda".
- You should now restart the computer.
